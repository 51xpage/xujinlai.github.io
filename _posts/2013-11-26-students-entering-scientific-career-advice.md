**How to be a winner -- advice for students starting into research work**

  


<http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~andre/general/student_research_advice.html>

  


**

**Don't get hung up trying to understand everything at the outset**

**  
**

The biggest challenge you face at the onset of any new project is that there is a huge (seemingly overwhelming) amount of stuff you need to know to tackle your problem properly. While this phenomenon is true in the small for the beginning researcher, it is also true in the large for any research project. So learning how to cope with this challenge is an important skill to to master to become a good researcher. In contrast, blocking your action and progress while waiting for complete knowledge is the road to failure.

  


Coping mechanisms employed by **winners** include:

  * prioritizing (what do I need to know most)
  * read (everything made available to you, and seek out more; but don't put months of reading between you and getting started doing things.)
  * multithreading (when blocked on one item or path, is there another I can productively pursue?)
  * pursuing multiple, possible solution techniques (maybe some have easier/less blocks paths than others)
  * wishful thinking (ok, let's assume this subproblem is solved, does that allow me to go on and solve other problems?)
  * pester people who might have some of the information you need (you might think they should know what you need to know, but often they don't have a clear idea of what you do and don't know; start by getting them to give you pointers to things you can use to help yourself. Show respect for their time and always follow up on the resources you've been given before asking for a personal explanation.)
  * propose working models --- maybe they are wrong or different from others, but they give you something to work with and something concrete to discuss and compare with others. You will refine your models continually, but it's good to have something concrete in mind to work with.

L****osers** will stop the first time they run into something they don't know, cannot solve a problem, or encounter trouble slightly out of what they consider ``their part'' of the problem and then offer excuses for why they cannot make any progress.
