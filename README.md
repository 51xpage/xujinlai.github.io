##Seeksky的blog
这是我的博客,使用的`kunka`的主题,详细见Kunka那个子块
其中我修改了主题的部分css,和`monokai`的代码高亮css进行了整合
并且增加了`inline code`的css,使整体更加协调好看.

##Kunka

> 这只是另外一个 Jekyll 主题文件。

###使用方法

* 把主题文件 clone 到你本地服务器，添加文章到 ```_posts``` 文件夹。
* 修改 ```_config.yml```，里面有很多可以配置的选项。
* 运行 ```jekyll server```，浏览器打开 http://localhost:4000 便可以看到新的主题。

# Jekyll-Bootstrap

The quickest way to start and publish your Jekyll powered blog. 100% compatible with GitHub pages

## Usage

For all usage and documentation please see: <http://jekyllbootstrap.com>

## Version

0.3.0 - stable and versioned using [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/).

**NOTE:** 0.3.0 introduces a new theme which is not backwards compatible in the sense it won't _look_ like the old version.
However, the actual API has not changed at all.
You might want to run 0.3.0 in a branch to make sure you are ok with the theme design changes.

## Contributing


To contribute to the framework please make sure to checkout your branch based on `jb-development`!!
This is very important as it allows me to accept your pull request without having to publish a public version release.

Small, atomic Features, bugs, etc.
Use the `jb-development` branch but note it will likely change fast as pull requests are accepted.
Please rebase as often as possible when working.
Work on small, atomic features/bugs to avoid upstream commits affecting/breaking your development work.

For Big Features or major API extensions/edits:
This is the one case where I'll accept pull-requests based off the master branch.
This allows you to work in isolation but it means I'll have to manually merge your work into the next public release.
Translation : it might take a bit longer so please be patient! (but sincerely thank you).
